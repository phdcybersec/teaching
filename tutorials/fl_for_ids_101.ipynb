In part I., we train a ML model to classify intrusion in network flows. In part II., we try to train the same model on locally collected data. Finally, in part III., we use FL to collaboratively train the model, benefiting from the experience of the others.\n",

        "You're in charge experimenting on novel intrusion detection techniques at your organization. Thanks to the effort of your security operation center (SOC), you have access to labelled network flow, with different attack classes. However, as labelling is extremely resource-consuming, you are limited in data quantity.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will use NSL-KDD, a well known dataset for intrusion detection <a name=\"ref1\"></a>[[1\\]](#note1), to represent the labeled data. However, only a tenth of it is produced by your organization. The other 90% come from other similar institutions working on the same task: you do not have access to their data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Commercial agreements are of no help here. Your hierarchy refuses to share any form of collected data, as it might expose sensitive information. Furthermore, as labeled data has value, the other companies won't share it either. Your goal is to build as collaborative system that you can use with your peers from other organizations to benefit from the experience and training of each other."
